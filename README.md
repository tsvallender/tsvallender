# Hi, I’m Trevor

I’m a software engineer focused on development with [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

I currently work at the [IUCN](https://iucn.org) on [IBAT](https://ibat-alliance.org). Previously I’ve held roles at [Foxsoft](https://foxsoft.co.uk) and [BoxStuff](https://boxstuff.com).

Currently I’m focused on learning more about wrangling GIS data and mapping.
