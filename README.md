# Hi, I’m Trevor

I’m a software engineer focused on development with [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org) and [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

I currently work at [IBAT](https://ibat-alliance.org), which is part of the [IUCN](https://iucn.org).

Currently I’m focused on learning more about wrangling GIS and mapping.
